# Add Task Forms and Use The Camunda Tasklist

## Goal
Sometimes the error can be resolved with manual interaction. In this lab you add a user task with a simple form to your process.

You have to define what dat should be displayed on that forms.

## Detailed Steps
### Process modeling
1. In case the payment failed, a user should check the data and correct, if possible. If the data could not be corrected to get the payment, the process continues with the error handling and compensation.
2. Open the payment process in the Modeler. Add a task on the outgoing sequence flow of the error boundary event. Name the task like **Check failed payment data**. Change the task type to User Task.
3. In the User assignment section of the property panel, fill the Candidate group as **accounting**.
4. In the Forms section, select **Camunda Forms** as the type. Fill the Form Reference with **checkPaymentDataForm**. This reference must become the Id of the form.
5. Add an exclusive gateway after the new user task and before the compensation throw event. Name the gateway like **Resolveable?**. Label the outgoing sequence flow giving an answer to the question.
6. Add a condition on the sequence flow from the exclusive gateway to the compensation throw event: `${errorResolved == false}`.
7. Connect the exclusive gateway with the Charge credit card task, if the data can be resolved by the user. Add a label to this sequence flow.
8. Add a condition to the sequence flow: `${errorResolved == true}`.

### Form modeling
9. In the Modeler, create a new Form for the Camunda Platform.
10. In the property panel of the form, change the Id from the generated value to the value you have set in the user task: **checkPaymentDataForm**.
11. Enter Cockpit and select the last completed process instance of the payment process from the history. Open the Variable tab. All (important) variables should be shown on the form. Additionally, a form field for the decision is required.
12. Drag a Text from the palette onto the canvas to provide a headline. The Text could be like
```
### Check the failed payment
```
13. Drag a Text Field for each String type variable. Enter Field labels for the user. Enter Keys matching the process variable names.
14. Add a Number field for each Double type variable (`orderTotal` and `openAmount`).
15. Add a Checkbox field for the decision of the user. It should get a Key of **errorResolved** to match the condition of the XOR gateway.

### Run with Tasklist
16. Open Tasklist at http://localhost:8080/camunda/app/tasklist.
17. Once all service tasks are completed and the payment failed, you will see a task under **All Tasks**.
18. Select the task and inspect the data on the form.
19. In case you miss some data or see any errors, you can change the form in the Modeler and redeploy the form. If you refresh the page in the tasklist the view will update to the latest form.
20. Open the Diagram tab of the form to see the highlighted task of the current process instance.
21. Switch back to the Form tab to work on the data.
22. Claim the task in the Tasklist. You can now edit the values.
23. As the current error is not resolveable, keep the checkbox unchecked and complete the form.

### Summary

In this exercise you have added a user task to the process and created a Form to display the process variables. These variables contain details of the error. The user can provide a decision if the credit card should be chared again or the payment failed.
