# Introduce compensation

## Goal

In this lab, we will include compensation to show that a task is compensated after a business error happened

## Short description

* After the error boundary event, morph the end event to a **Compensate End Event**
* Attach a boundary event to the **deduct amount from credit** service task and morph it to a **Compensate Boundary Event**
* Add a compensation task by clicking the task icon in the context of the **Compensate Boundary Event** and name it **Refund credit**
* Adjust the `testInvalidExpiryDate` test to assert that the completed process instance has passed the **Refund credit** task

## Detailed steps

1. Currently, you should have an **Error Boundary Event** on your **charge credit card** task. The outgoing sequence flow should point to a **Message End Event**.
2. Morph this **Message End Event** to be a **Compensate End Event**.
3. Now, add a **Boundary Event** to the **deduct amount from credit** task.
4. Morph the **Boundary Event** to a **Compensate Boundary Event**.
5. In the context of this **Compensate Boundary Event**, create a Task. This task will not be connected with a sequence flow, but with a **Association** (which is correct and wanted). Name this task **refund credit amount**.
6. Now go to your test `testInvalidExpiryDate`. Add another statement to the last assert statement so that the whole statement will look like this:
    ```java
   assertThat(processInstance)
        .isEnded()
        .hasPassed("Activity_Charge_Credit_Card")
        .hasNotPassed("Event_Payment_Complete")
        .hasPassed(<Id of the compensate end event>)
        .hasPassed(<Id of the compensation task>);
    ```
7. Run your tests.
